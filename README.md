# dicee-multiplayer
Description:
This project is an advance and more improved version of my initial dice project.
Its a multiplayer game, player score >=10 will win.
After every dice roll the score obtained can be stored by the player which will be deducted from the score display and add to the total high score.
For dice value of 1 the score of the person will be set to zero.
